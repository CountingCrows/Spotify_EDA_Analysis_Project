# Spotify_EDA_Analysis_Project
In this portfolio, we'll delve into the nuances of data preparation and analysis. Starting with the preprocessing key datasets, we'll focus on fine-tuning the Spotify dataset by finding the most popular artists to multiple feature plots. Our exploration involves identifying meaningful metrics, and ultimately visualizing our findings. This process aims to provide a clear understanding of our objectives, datasets, and the pertinent questions our analysis addresses.

## Dataset
We'll explore the Spotify 2017 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geomack/spotifyclassification) , with the guidance of [Spotify Audio Feature](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features). We'll do an Exploratory Data Analysis to gain as many insights we can from the dataset.

## Tasks
- Top 5 most popular artists
- Top 5 loudest tracks
- Artist with the most danceability song
- Top 5 instrumentalness tracks
- Multiple feature plots:
  - tempo
  - loudness
  - accousticness
  - danceability
  - duration_ms
  - energy
  - instrumentalness
  - liveness
  - speechiness
  - valence
- Top 10 energetic tracks
- Most common durations
- Top 10 tracks with the most valence

## Data Cleaning
We find out that our dataset is clean. Therefore, we just need to check the types of the data and make sure we have the columns we need to do our analysis.
